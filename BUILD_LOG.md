# Build Log: Lumen Console

## 2026-11-13 (Friday)

### Highlight: getting past the GitHub login

**The challenge.** The project was ready on this Mac, but the first `git push` to GitHub (`akp375/lumen-console`) needed us to sign in from the command line. GitHub no longer accepts an account password for `git push`, so typing the normal GitHub password fails even when it is correct.

**How we solved it.**

1. **Generated a personal access token** inside the GitHub account settings.
2. **Saved the token in Passwords** (the Mac password manager), so it is stored safely and never sits in a project file or chat.
3. **Connected through the Terminal:** when `git push` asked for a password, we pasted the token instead of the GitHub password.
4. Git on this Mac stores that sign-in in the **macOS Keychain** (`osxkeychain`), so later pushes go through without asking again.
5. Both pushes worked. `main` and `dev` are on GitHub, and each local branch is linked to its GitHub copy.

**Lesson.** If a push ever asks for a password again, the token has probably expired or been revoked. Make a new token on GitHub and enter it when asked. Never paste the token into chat or into a project file.

### Other work today

- **Project set up** (`a841d60`): new Next.js app with Supabase, the Anthropic SDK and Recharts. This first commit went to `main`.
- **`dev` branch created**: all work from here on happens on `dev`.
- **Safety rules added** (`d3e31c4`): `CLAUDE.md` now covers no `sudo`, no deleting files, no global installs, staying inside the project folder, keeping `.env.local` private and protecting `main`.
- **Rebranded** (`ede1ece`): the app header and browser tab title now say "Lumen Console".
- **Product brief added to `CLAUDE.md`**: it covers the product, the demo company (Lumen AI), the three modules, the stack, the build rules and the working style. The safety rules stay in place.
- **Started this build log.**

### Next up

- Build the synthetic Lumen AI dataset: 150 accounts, opportunities, billing and token usage.
- Set up the Supabase tables with Row Level Security on.
- Create `lib/metrics.ts` and the Claude API wrapper that logs each call to `llm_calls`.
